/**
 * Screen render tests — run in a real browser (see tests/run-screens.cjs).
 *
 * audit.test.ts proves the MATH. This proves the SCREENS: that every page
 * actually renders seeded data, and that the numbers which reach the DOM are
 * the ones the ledger says they should be.
 *
 * It exists because the v50 refactor moved every repo-derived `useMemo` in
 * these pages onto `useRepoMemo`, and nothing but tsc was exercising them —
 * a blank page, or a stale zero, would have shipped unseen.
 *
 * Why a browser and not renderToString: most list screens load their rows in
 * a `useEffect`, which server rendering never runs, so they would all render
 * empty and the test would prove nothing. Mounting for real with createRoot
 * runs effects, which is exactly the code path being verified.
 *
 * Safety: `@/lib/firebase` is aliased to tests/stubs/firebase (isBrowser =
 * false), so the repositories are pure in-memory caches here and there is no
 * code path to the live database.
