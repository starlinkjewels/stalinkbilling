 * trades one way, but it cannot NET. A party carrying a 9,850 payable

 * 11,000 receivable — the same party counted twice, on both sides of the
 * dashboard, when their real position is 1,150 receivable. The party's own
 * statement always showed 1,150, because it works from one signed running
 * balance; the dashboard disagreed with it.
 *
 * So: fold everything into one signed number per party, exactly as the
 * statement does, and only then decide which side it lands on. A party can
 * now appear in Receivable or Payable, never both.

 * sales and purchase returns increase what they owe you; purchases, sale
 * returns and money you've received reduce it.
