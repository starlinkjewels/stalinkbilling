/**
 * The rules for a bill that did not send.
 *
 * Everything the header dot does makes a broken WhatsApp link *visible*. This
 * is the part that stops it *costing* anything: a send that fails is kept, and
 * goes out on its own when the link comes back, instead of being a toast that
 * scrolls away while the customer walks out.
 *
 * Pure, and separate from the queue itself, because the interesting decisions
 * here are all judgement calls about somebody else's money and reputation:
 *
 *  - **What may be retried at all.** A bill for a party with no phone number
 *    will fail identically forever. Queueing it is not resilience, it is a
 *    permanent red badge the shop learns to ignore.
 *  - **What must never be retried automatically.** If we cannot tell whether
 *    the message went out, sending it again may deliver the customer a second
 *    copy of their invoice. That is a person's decision, not a timer's.
