 *  1. A bill's stored `bankPaidAmount` snapshot (inflated by the edit bug —
 *     re-saving a part-bank-paid bill after a Payment landed on it credited
 *     the account with that payment's money too).
 *  2. An account's stored `balance`, which those inflated snapshots pushed up
 *     and which nothing recomputes, since it's only ever nudged by deltas.
 *
 * So bill snapshots are corrected FIRST, then each account's true balance is
 * re-derived from the corrected documents via buildBankLedger — the same
 * engine the passbook page already uses, which covers every way money reaches
 * an account (bills, payments, expenses, deposits/withdrawals, opening
 * balance). Pure and side-effect free: callers show this to the user and only
 * then decide to write.
