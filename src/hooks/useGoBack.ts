/**
 * One step back — the way a back button is supposed to behave.
 *
 * Every detail page used to send you to its own list with a forward
 * navigation (`navigate({ to: "/items" })`). That looks the same and is not:
 *
 *  - It PUSHES a new history entry, so the browser's own Back button then
 *    returns to the detail page you just left. Press both a few times and you
 *    are stuck in a loop.
 *  - The list remounts from scratch, so a search you had typed is gone — the
 *    "I searched, opened a result, came back, and it had forgotten
 *    everything" complaint.
 *  - It ignores where you actually came from. Reaching an item from the
 *    global search on the dashboard and pressing back should return you to
 *    the dashboard, not drop you on the items list.
 *
 * `fallbackTo` is for the cases where there is genuinely nothing behind this
 * page: a link opened in a fresh tab, a bookmark, the print window's escape
 * hatch. Going "back" there would leave the app, so it goes to the list
 * instead.

 * also works on the pages that have no back chevron.

/**
 * Escape closes the screen you are on — anywhere in the app.
 *
 * It used to work only where a back chevron happened to be rendered, so the
 * same key did something on a bill and nothing at all on the Items list. One
 * key should mean one thing, so this is mounted once at the root and covers
 * every page.
 *
 * The order of who gets it is the whole design, innermost first:
 *
 *   1. A dropdown that is open — it calls preventDefault, and this checks.
 *   2. An open dialog — Radix closes it; taking the key here would leave the
 *      page with the sheet still standing on top of the next one.
 *   3. A form that claims Escape (see useEscapeToLeave) — "leave THIS form,
 *      asking first if there is work on it" beats "go back a page".
 *   4. The open tab — the app keeps its own Chrome-style tab strip, and
 *      "close this screen" means that tab, exactly as its × does. You land
 *      on the tab that takes its place, not wherever history happened to be.
 *   5. Nothing in the strip? Then back one step.
 *
 * With no tab and nothing behind the page — a fresh tab, a bookmark, the
 * print window's escape hatch — Escape does nothing at all. It never tries to
 * close the BROWSER tab: a page cannot close a tab it did not open, and
 * quietly shutting the app on a keystroke is not something to attempt on a
 * till.
